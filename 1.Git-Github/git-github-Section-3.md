```ruby
In this section I learned stashing, differences between local and remote commits,
branching, merging, merge conflicts and reverse commit.

Merge conflicts happens whenever a single file is being update/edit with different branches
or people. I perform merge conflicts and experience resolve conflicts using 'Mine'.
