```ruby
I have much ease using the GUI for repositories which is Sourcetree.
I watch the video explanation and tutorial about git and sourcetree while perform everything on my computer,
sadly the Unity something cannot run on my device and only focusing on sourcetree and its practical uses.

I have a sample commit using sourcetree on 'Training' folder on my github with the filename 'sampletext.txt'.
